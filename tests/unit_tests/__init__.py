"""
Package that contains unit tests.

Unit tests are used to test individual components and layers of the application:
 - API (route handlers and schemas)
 - Jobs
 - Services (business logic functions, input and outcome)
 - External backends (interactions with external services)

For every layer dependants are mocked or use test implementations.
